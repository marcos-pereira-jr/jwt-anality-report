**IMPORTANT:** This library doesn't validate the token, any well-formed JWT can be decoded. You should validate the token in your server-side logic by using something like [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt), [koa-jwt](https://github.com/stiang/koa-jwt), [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer), etc.
